This plugin adds Siteous (a short URLs service provider) button on your posts to shortify your post URL.

== Description ==

My buddy, [Adham Somantrie](http://adhamsomantrie.com), has written a great URL shortener called [Siteo.us](http://siteo.us). This service is still in alpha phase, but I believe it will reach great features.

Based on its development blog, I wrote a piece of WP plugin code to make this thing easier to use.

After installed and activated, the plugin will add a "siteous and share" link button on your bottom of posts. You can easily convert your post URL link into short URL and share it to everyone using Siteous.

== Installation ==

All you have to do is just grab the `siteous-it.phps` file, rename it to `siteous-it.php`, upload it to your WP plugins directory, and then activate the plugin. It's just that simple.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to add some code into theme files? =

No you don't. You even don't need to touch the theme files.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First and simple version of plugin
* Made while waiting for Taraweh praying time.
